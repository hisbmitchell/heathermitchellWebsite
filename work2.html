               <i> Memories of Cars </i> reflects on the streams of traffic which are ever present on large highways that 
                    flow and merge in a huge display of human cooperation and mechanical triumph. One’s own body 
                    becomes inseparable from the car as do the cars and bodies of the people around them. 
                    We communicate with our new bodies, saying that I will move left, that I am stopping, 
                    that I’ll let you in, that I’ll keep you out. These car bodies are marketed to us as symbols
                    of our sexuality, our social status, our individualism, and our desire to surpass human limits. 
                    They are bonded to us by our desires and their perceived ability to fulfill them. These memories of 
                    cars in the way we know them are incredibly specific to the time and place in history we live 
                    in, a memory of temporary reality shared by our generations. They are so interwoven into our 
                    lives and personhood they are often invisible. <br><br>
                    It is not until the system of cars breaks down
                    or changes that we notice it. Traffic accidents interrupt the flowing stream of vehicles and
                    make us violently aware how different we are from the car bodies we have adopted. Approaching 
                    self-driving car technologies make us feel threatened in our car-autonomy. The dinosaur bones 
                    our cars consume are limited in supply, and their consumption contributes to a temperature change
                    in the whole planet. The daily flow of cars through our lives is beautiful and a strong memory 
                    we will hold of this time in human history, but this flow also holds underneath it at all times
                    inevitable breakdown.
