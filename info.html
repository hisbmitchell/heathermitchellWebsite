        About <br><br>
        <u>Heather Mitchell</u> is a new media artist based in Montreal, Canada.<br><br>

        She uses her art making as a vehicle to ask questions about the world and to share that process with others. Her questions primarily focus on understanding the complex systems and moral dillemas which humans create amongst themselves and how they can be collectively interpreted through narrative and metaphor. <br><br>

        <!-- The subject matter of her work focuses on systems such as economies, computer networks, bio-engineering labs, and flows of traffic. us powerful conceptual tools to understand ourselves and the world in which we live â€“ or to at least express collectively our lack of understanding. <br><br><br> -->
