Data sonification created using MAX MSP and historical stock datasets of 20 years of the international stock market, from Dec  2 1998 (the date high-frequency automated trading was made legal) to December 2 2018.<br><br>
           
           <i>Desire Beyond Survival</i> uses historical data of
stock market trajectories and trading algorithm logics to directly create sounds that are complex
and interconnected in the ways that markets systems are. Combined datasets from stock market
indices, oil futures, gold futures, and buy and sell decisions from trading algorithms control
different aspects of the sounds. The work provides listeners with the opportunity to reflect on the emerging nature of our
markets. Questioning the long term goals of the market economy and how human desires are
represented in high-speed trade is of vital importance. Some of our desires have brought about a
global market economy whose logics are failing to address some of the greatest problems of our
times.<br><br>
<i>Desire Beyond Survival</i> is an emotional experience about a system built on economic theories
that attempt to predict human complexity in relationship to capitalism. Even though it can seem
abstracted away from our every day world, the stock market is in the end still predicated upon the basic humans instincts we all
embody. <br><br>
